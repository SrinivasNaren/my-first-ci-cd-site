# My First CI/CD Site

This is a minimal static website that deploys automatically to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions**.

## What’s inside
- `index.html` – your webpage
- `style.css` – simple styling
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` – CI/CD workflow that publishes to the `gh-pages` branch

## Quick start
1. Create a new GitHub repo and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Branch = gh-pages**.
3. Push any change to `main`. The workflow will publish to GitHub Pages.
4. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` to view your site.
