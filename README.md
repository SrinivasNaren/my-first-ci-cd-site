# 🚀 My First CI/CD Website with GitHub Actions

This project is a **simple Python-based web application** that is automatically built, tested, and deployed using **GitHub Actions**.  
Every time we push code to the repository, GitHub Actions runs a **CI/CD pipeline** that:
1. Builds the project
2. Runs tests (if any)
3. Deploys the latest version to **GitHub Pages** 🚀

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow Explanation

**Continuous Integration (CI)**:

* Every push to GitHub triggers the workflow
* Code is checked and dependencies installed
* If there are tests, they are run here

**Continuous Deployment (CD)**:

* After CI passes, code is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages**
* No need to manually upload files
