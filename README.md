## ✨ What I Built
I created a **Python-based web application** and set up a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions**.  
Whenever I update the code and push it to GitHub, it **automatically builds, tests, and deploys** the latest version to **GitHub Pages** — without me touching the server. 😎  

---

## 🛠 How I Built It
Here’s the **step-by-step magic** I did:

1️⃣ **Project Setup**  
- Created a Python project with `index.html` and a simple `main.py` web server.  
- Added `requirements.txt` for dependencies.  

2️⃣ **GitHub Actions Workflow**  
- Inside `.github/workflows/`, I created `deploy.yml` to define my CI/CD steps.  
- Workflow runs every time I push to `main`.

3️⃣ **CI/CD Steps**  
- **Build** → Install dependencies  
- **Test** → (Optional) Run unit tests  
- **Deploy** → Publish website automatically to GitHub Pages  

4️⃣ **Go Live**  
- Website is live at:  
  🌐 **[https://srinivasnaren.github.io/my-first-ci-cd-site/](https://srinivasnaren.github.io/my-first-ci-cd-site/)**

## 💡 Why I Used CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- **Automation**: No need for manual deployment — saves time & avoids mistakes  
- **Consistency**: Every deployment follows the exact same process  
- **Learning**: Hands-on experience with real DevOps tools  
- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages is free and perfect for static/dynamic small apps

This version is:

* **One clean page**
* **Stylish** (centered headers, badges, icons, emojis)
* **Explains What, How, Why** in detail
* **Readable in GitHub** without extra scrolling

If you want, I can also **add an ASCII art or banner** at the top so it looks like a “wow” portfolio piece when someone opens your repo.
