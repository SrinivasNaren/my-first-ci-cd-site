# 🚀 My First CI/CD Project with GitHub Actions

This is my **first end-to-end CI/CD project**, where I built and deployed a simple Python-based website using **GitHub Actions** and **GitHub Pages**.

---

## 📖 What I Did
- Created a **basic Python web app** (can be Flask or SimpleHTTPServer).
- Designed a **CI/CD workflow** using **GitHub Actions**.
- Configured automatic deployment to **GitHub Pages**.
- Tested the workflow by pushing code changes and watching them go live instantly.

---

## 🛠 How I Did It
1. **Set up project files** – `index.html`, `main.py`, and `requirements.txt`.
2. **Created a GitHub Actions workflow** in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
3. Configured workflow to:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run tests (optional)
   - Deploy to **GitHub Pages**
4. Committed and pushed the code to GitHub — the site went live automatically. 🚀

## 💡 Why This Project is Useful
- Automates deployment — no manual uploads.
- Ensures code is always tested before going live.
- Teaches the basics of **DevOps pipelines** for beginners.
